        <h1>Kohei Uchimura: Career</h1>
        <p>His achievements are unparalleled in modern gymnastics. He became the first male gymnast in 44 years to retain the Olympic individual all around title, winning gold in London 2012 and Rio 2016. He also led Japan to team gold in Rio, ending a long drought for his nation. Beyond the Olympics, he dominated the World Championships, winning six consecutive all around titles from 2009 to 2015. His routines were celebrated for their artistry, balance, and consistency, setting a new standard in the sport. Many consider him the greatest all around gymnast in history, not only for his medal count but for the elegance and precision he brought to every performance.</p>
